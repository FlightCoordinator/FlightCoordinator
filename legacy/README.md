# Older Client

This is the previous client built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. It was deprecated in favor of a newer client developed with Next.js.

This older client is no longer functional because the backend server was updated after its deprecation, and the data grid components on the frontend are not configured to handle the newer server responses.
